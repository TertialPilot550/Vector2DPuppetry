# 2D Vector Puppetry
Author: sammc

This is my personal attempt at creating a 2D Vector Puppetry Software, a method of animation similar to the concept of 'rigging' in digital animation, where characters have body parts that can be moved and manipulated individually, rather than redrawing the entire character.

## Getting Started
    - Run the Snappy.jar application file
    - Click 'New Project'
    - Add any image resources you need to the Images file in the newly created project folder
    - Edit away!

## Features
    - Entities - Entities are any objects drawn to the screen that is part of the foreground. Users can create new entities out of one image, or out of several images linked together using an intuitive entity creation wizard. 
    - Onion Skinning - all entities will have their position from the last screen capture drawn
    at 50% opacity, only visible to the user of the program, so that the artist can see how the character moves across frames.
    - File Manipulation - Save entities, projects, and editing sessions to keep track of your work, and build out multiple possibities for each scene.
    - 2D Image Rendering - By keeping the project constrained to 2 dimensions, AffineTransformations significantly ease the rendering process. On screen user interfaces also allow the user to zoom and pan 
    around the background image easily.
    - Easy Entity Manipulation - Control panels mouse controls make it easy to move, reflect, or stretch any entity any way you need to.
